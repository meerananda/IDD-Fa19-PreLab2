## Part 4: Idea Generation

Below are a list of ideas of interactions that can be done using a digital timer. Each idea is accompanied by a sketch to break it down further.
1. Start a timer as the user throws a ball into the air and stop it as the user catches it.
1. Turn an LED on for shorter and shorter intervals until it turns completely off.
1. A whack-a-mole style game using LEDs and switches where the user has a certain amount of time in which to hit the correct switch.
1. A beats mixer where the user can input audio loops and select how long each loop should play for before going to the next.
1. Measure how many times a user can manually fade an LED from max to min within one minute.
1. Measure how many resistors a user can identify within one minute.
1. A rapid fire quiz game where the users can use buzzers to indicate if they know the answer, and the user with the most correct answers within one minute wins.
1. Play a C major scale with whole notes, then repeat with half notes, then quarter, eighth and sixteenth notes.
1. A dimmer bedtime light which dims an LED slowly over the span of 30 mins. Inversely, an LED that brightens over half an hour as an alarm clock.
1. A game with a 10 second countdown for the user to click the correct input switch, and if they do so correctly then another 10 seconds is added on to the remaining number from the previous countdown.
